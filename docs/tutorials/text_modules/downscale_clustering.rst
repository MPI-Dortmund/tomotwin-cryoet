TomoTwin should be used to pick on tomograms without denoising or lowpass filtering. But you may use these tomograms for visualizing the picks in Napari. In this case, you should make sure the denoised/lowpass filtered tomogram has the same pixel size as the one you will pick on (downscaling it if necessary).
